This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## This is multipurpose (for my own needs) template done using Cursor AI.
I wanted to check what is the hype around Cursor and how it works, so I've built this out of curiousity and to have it as reference for my future ideas (maybe).
